# The Importance of Solving More Questions in GATE Preparation


The Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) is not just a test of theoretical knowledge but a timed, competitive exam that demands strategic preparation. Solving questions both PYQ and new questions that are available in the test series are very important to improve your problem solving ability and to boost confidence.

#### Enhancing Problem-Solving Skills

Solving a variety of questions exposes aspirants to diverse problem-solving scenarios. Problem solving is more important than going through the notes againa nd again. Revision is important but personally I find solving problems have more priority thatn revising.

#### Time Management

It is an essential skill to master. Duiring my last months of prepartion I have attempted various full length mock test as well as previous year gate paper as a full length test. I have experimemted various strategies and ways in which I can attempt the exam to find out the best way which suited me so that I can utilize the 3 hrs efficiently.

#### Understanding Exam Pattern

If you do enough PYQ you can sense some pattern in the way GATE is asking questions.It has a specific way which make the aspirants use the concepts to understand the question and use aptitude or problem solving skills to solve it.

#### Revise

Differnt people have different methods to revise. It all depends on our personality and interest in the subjects. I used to revise by solving questions and look into my notes and study the concepts and areas in which I made a mistake while solving the quesitons.

#### Building Confidence

Successfully solving a wide range of questions gives confidence when we are going forward. Confidence is key during the exam, and a well-practiced candidate is more likely to approach questions with a clear mindset, minimizing anxiety.

#### Resources for Practice

To maximize the benefits of solving more questions, we should utilize various resources, including:

- **Previous Year Question Papers:** Practice with questions from previous years to understand the exam trends.
- **Mock Tests:** Simulate exam conditions by taking mock tests regularly.
- **Online Platforms:** Explore online platforms offering practice questions and quizzes.


**Finally** It all comes to the last 3 hrs in which we are giving the exam. ***"Do not go gentle in to that good night"***.
