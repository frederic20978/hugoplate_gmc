#### Intro

Hi everyone, I am Frederic J Maliakkal, and I have secured **AIR-16** in GATE CSE 2023. I started my preparation at the end of feb 2022 and I‚Äôve tried to summarise my experience, resources and strategies I followed through my preparation for GATE 2023.

#### Bit about me 

I did my **bachelors in Electronics and Communications** Engineering from College of Engineering Trivandrum, Kerala. After graduation I joined the company which I got in campus placement. I was an embedded engineer in Tata elxsi till 2019. Then I quit my job and started freelancing in Web development and App development. After signficant thought I decided to quit my path as a developer and go for Masters. Thats when I decided to give GATE and it was already feb 2022. So I decided to prepare seriously for **GATE 2023**. I had some commitments till June and after that I was focusing my entire time on GATE preparation.

In the initial days when I had to work along with preparation it was tough and I was only able to dedicate about 1-2 hrs per day. Post July I spend around 5-6 hours daily for the preparation. I had my down times where I was only able to study say 1hr or maybe not at all. But in an average I was almost consistent and I can say 5-6 hrs daily is a fairly good approximation.

#### Major struggles

1. As I was not a CSE student, almost everything in the GATE syllabus was new to me.
2. I started some of the subjects from scratch in which I had no idea what was happening.
3. It was hard to start and learn after 4 years of Gap.
4. No idea what to follow. Do I need to join an institute? If yes, then which institute to join?


#### Important milestones

##### 1. Learning phase

This was an important challenge for  me as I was new to almost every topic in CSE. I joined a coaching institution and followed their lectures **consistently**. I joined in an **offline** class setting to have motivation from the peers and also to approach the faculties in person. I attended almost **every class** with consistency and made notes ina detailed and well descriptive manner. I tried to do the questions in the materials provided by the institution. I was able to do it for some subjects. So basically by the end of august I had my entire **notes** prepared from the lectures. But I was not comfortable with the way in which they took Computer Networks and Engineering mathematics. So I spent whole september learning and creating notes for CN and EM again from another source online which I was able to follow nicely.
So basically I completed my notes taking and conceptual understanding by the end of septemberüòÖ.

##### 2. PYQ

As a GATE aspirant these are the questions that are a **must solve**. So my strategy was to solve the questions in topicwise sequential manner for evey subject **till GATE 2014**. And I started solving the questions by taking subjects one by one. I was also preparing **shortnotes** for subjects alongside. So which ever subject I was preparing shortnotes, I was doing both PYQs as well as subject and topic wise tests.
**The remaining set of PYQs I gave as full length tests and analyzed thoroughly**. It helped me unsertand the level of my preparation and how to actually appear for the real GATE exam. 

##### 3. Test series

From the month of august itself I started giving tests from the test series provided by the institution in which I joined for coaching. I was mostly doing subject wise and topic wise tests. Then by the end of november I took **2 more test series**. From the start of december I was fully concentrated on giving tests and analyzing. I was giving atleast 2 full lenght tests in a week lately which increased to a test on alternate day. I have seen people making this mistake of not giving full length tests till they feel ready to give. The hard truth is that even if you are ready or not you should stasrta giving full length test atleast from end of november and should give atleast 10-15 full length tests before actually appearing for the exam. I was scoring all around the place in tests. I scored from 53- 83 and I know it is a wide range. I was even tensed about this because what if the GATE actual exam is like the exam in which I scored 53. But it turns out the more tests you give the better you are at judging hard papers and getting a slightly better results in those.

##### 4. Analyze

I spend a good enough time in analyzing the tests I gave. I always tried to solve the question which I was not able to solve in test **without time constraint** and I bookmarked those questions for solving again later. I had a **book for silly mistakes** and I used to write what silly mistakes I made and how to correct them. I use read this note before writing full length test to reduce silly mistakes and I think it helped a lot.

##### 5. Social circle

Since We were near the coaching institute for my entire preparation we had a **good friend circle** over there. It was fun and motivating to be around them. We even used to take care of our **physical health**. My roommate over there was a fitness freak and he even motivated me to do fitness and it helped me lot. We were even doing yoga for a while. 
I c**ompletely avoided social media** during the preparation and for the last 2-3 months I was even using button phone instead of smart phone. It is not a mandatory thing to do, but it did help me significantly in improving my focus and dedication as I was less distracted.

##### 6. Last weeks

The last weeks were very hard for me as I was **continuosly sick** and having so much self doubt that what if I mess up on the final day. I had an elaborate plan for the last weeks but because of lack of physical as well as mental health I was not able to follow it. I called my **family and many old friends** for and they helped me a lot during those periods. I was back to full confidence and ready to give my everything for the final 3 hrs. I stopped doing tests 1 week before GATE and even studied very less in the last 3-4 days and didnt study at all on the last day. I confident and ready by that time.

##### 7. Final day

Many of my friends had the same exam centre. So we all went together and occupied our seats. We even got the same roomüòá. In my room atleast 3-4 of my friends too were there. It was a good thing to ease the pressure. So we were chilling till the last moment. Then came the exam paper and the 3 hrs began. The apti part was okay even though little tricky for me. After that since I was not that attendive in reading the instructions I didnt notice that the one mark questions wil be first then followed by 2 marks. During my mock test series the strategy I was finally finding success was going sequentially. But after solving 4 one mark questions I understood that the paper is easy and I should do the 2 marks questions first. I went and solved 2 marks followed by 1 mark questions. I was done 20 mins before. But I had marked too many questions for review, like 25-30 of them. So I figured out I would try to solve 4 questions which I didnt solve instead of reviewing questions. So I solved those 4 questions in 20 mins and hence answered all the 65 questions.

#### How to stay consistent throughout?

I too had hard days throughout the journey. The difficulties are different in different times. During the early or initial phase of the preparation the difficulty is to stay focused for longer hours and to be **consistent**üòê. Since GATE will be say 5-6 months away we will not be that motivated to spend time everyday. But comes novemeber or december when most people start to give full length tests and you feel the competition, then the difficulties will be in the way of feeling the pressure and feeling hopeless or fearful. 
During the entire journey I used to watch videos of many previous toppers which are availble in youtube which helped me a lot. I even used to **read blogs** and answers by many of the topppers which is one of the reason I am writing these blogs, to help aspirants in need, to stay motivated. My  roommate was so hardworking and he too helped me a lot in staying motivated and keeping my hopes high.

#### Result and Expectation

The exam was easy, but then I was too afraid to discuss questions with peers as silly mistakes will take a big toll on our rank as the paper was an easy one. When the key came I compared it with some institution key and was getting aroud 80 and was so happy to see that. But then I realised I did poorly in aptitude(got 9.6 in 15) which I usually do good in mock tests and it was silly mistakes. So even in the final day we cant avoid silly mistakes completelyüòá. I was a little sad that I could have got 6-7 more marks which I lost in silly mistakes, but come on I think everyone will loose that 6 marks no matter what.

#### Some Advices

- Give importance to solve problems. people who already have problem solving capability can do more revision, but generally an **average aspirant** should give more **importance to solve problems**.
- Do not follow any resources which you dont understand. If you dont understand a particular subject or topic search for other resources till you are good with the topic. You should have a **very good conceptual understanding** to crack GATE questions.
- PYQs are a muust do.
- Dont follow anyones strategy or timetable. Everyone have different journey when it comes to GATE. It even changes you as a person. Take inspiration and suggestions from others but never try to fully follow their journey.
- Dont waste more than needed time on test series questions. Some of them can even be wrong. They are generally 90% correct, so spend time on PYQs but think whether its worth it before spending time on some silly test series question.
- Give enough importance to your **physical and mental wellness**. If you keep yourself healthy you can do more better than you imagine every single day.
-  Enroll in **at least 2 test series **to understand the competition and test environment.
- Try to stay confident in the last month and it will help you a great deal. 
- Try to give test series or subject tests even without revising, that way you can mimic the GATE exam as you cannot revise everything in the day or the week before.
- Be helpful and try to appreciate a **peer group**.
- And finally if you have worked hard enough you will see the benefits of it. So dont worry too much about what will happen, try to stay in the present and think about what you can do right now.

**Gate is an exam which need you to have some qualities of a winner. You need to be consistent, determinant and hardworking at the least. So it will help you to transform to better person if you are persistent enough. And I think that is the key differentiating factor between the top rankers and others.**
